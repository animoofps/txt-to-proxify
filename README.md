To use with proxifier do this: 



In Proxifier go to File → Profile Auto Update…. 

Tick the option “Update profile on start” (or similar wording). 

Enter your raw GitHub URL of the profile file.

Choose the correct mode:

Click Update Now, then every time Proxifier starts it will fetch the profile from the URL and apply it.
