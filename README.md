To use with proxifier do this: 



In Proxifier go to File → Profile Auto Update…. 

Tick the option “Update profile on start” (or similar wording). 

Enter your raw GitHub URL of the profile file.
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/animoofps/txt-to-proxify/main/proxy_profile.ppx

Choose the correct mode:
If the URL points to a folder containing profiles: Proxifier will look for the profile with the same name as the currently loaded one. 

If the URL points to a single file: Proxifier will update that file if its name matches the current profile name (or you manually update). 

Click Update Now (if available) to test immediately. Then every time Proxifier starts it will fetch the profile from the URL and apply it.
